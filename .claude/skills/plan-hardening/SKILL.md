# Plan Hardening

Audience: `team-lead` only.

Use this only for phase-plan hardening before implementation starts or resumes.

If the user invokes this skill, that means that the plan details have already
been discussed and are fresh in `crl` context. Do not request details from
the user, the details will surface when the plan is delivered.

`team-lead` is responsible for routing, worktree creation, and assignment
metadata. `team-lead` is not the authority for rewriting the plan.

The user-discussed deliverable scope is authoritative. Hardening should welcome
improvements that clarify, tighten, split, or otherwise make the plan more
executable when those improvements are consistent with what the user already
discussed with `crl`. Hardening must resist and push back on substantial scope
changes that are at odds with that user discussion.

## Preconditions

- the target phase worktree already exists
- `worktree_path` and `branch` are known
- `sc-compose` is available
- the plan has already been discussed with `crl`

## Expected Result

The task must end with two required hardening passes:
- pass 1: sprint-scope hardening
- pass 2: document-consistency hardening

Together they must produce:
- complete/consistent planning docs
- a hardened sprint doc for every sprint still required to finish the phase
- an explicit detailed deliverables list in every hardened sprint doc
- no unassigned in-scope implementation work
- no overloaded sprint whose deliverables cannot all land at a production-ready
  level
- explicit code samples or signatures for important interfaces, features,
  enums, protocol types, and boundary contracts
- branch pushed, validation reported, team-lead critical review completed or
  explicitly requested, and QA requested only after both passes and that review

Substantial scope changes are not valid hardening output. Examples:
- dropping, replacing, or weakening a user-discussed deliverable
- converting a runtime/code sprint into a docs/lint-only sprint
- retargeting work to a different phase or integration branch
- adding a new deliverable that materially changes the implementation outcome
  promised to the user

Any remaining in-scope work without sprint ownership is a `GAP`. If more
sprints are needed, hardening must create them.

## Team-Lead Steps

1. Prepare:
   - `phase_id`
   - `task_id`
   - `description`
   - `worktree_path`
   - `branch`
   - `pr_target`
   - `source_of_truth`
   - optional `questions_or_concerns`
   - `references`
2. Render `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening.xml.j2` with
   `sc-compose` for pass 1 (sprint-scope hardening).
3. Send the rendered pass-1 ATM task to `crl`.
4. Review the pass-1 result:
   - final finding count is `0`
   - every remaining work item is assigned to a sprint
   - missing sprint docs were created if needed
   - every committed deliverable is assigned to exactly one sprint
   - every sprint doc has an explicit, detailed deliverables list rather than
     umbrella bullets or thematic placeholders
   - if any sprint was overloaded or had production-ready risk, it was split
   - important interfaces/features/enums/boundaries have explicit code samples
   - branch was pushed and validation reported
5. Render `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening-consistency.xml.j2`
   with `sc-compose` for pass 2 (consistency/ambiguity hardening).
6. Send the rendered pass-2 ATM task to `crl`.
7. Review the pass-2 result:
   - final finding count is `0`
   - cross-document contradictions are resolved
   - boundary ownership and ADR coverage are explicit
   - ambiguous wording is removed
   - branch was pushed and validation reported
8. Critically review the hardened plan before QA:
   - read the updated phase plan and every new or changed sprint doc
   - review sprint deliverables for concrete ownership, production-ready scope,
     and execution clarity
   - review that each sprint deliverables section is an explicit detailed list
     of individually verifiable items, not a broad category label
   - review acceptance criteria for explicit, testable closeout gates
   - review whether any sprint still appears overloaded and should be split
   - review whether any important interface/feature/enum is still promised
     without an explicit code sample or signature
   - push back on vague wording, missing deliverables, or unverifiable
     acceptance criteria
   - request another hardening pass from `crl` if the plan is still ambiguous
9. Only after the critical review passes, route the plan to `quality-mgr` for
   a focused plan QA review.

`source_of_truth` should point at the already-approved planning sources:
- reviewed planning docs in the repo
- a verbatim user-approved plan capsule
- explicit references to prior planning discussion already completed with
  `crl`

If `source_of_truth`, `questions_or_concerns`, or repo documents imply a
substantial scope change from what the user already discussed with `crl`,
that is a stop condition. The hardening pass must not rewrite the sprint scope
to match it. Push back to `team-lead`, describe the scope conflict explicitly,
and require user discussion before proceeding.

If `questions_or_concerns` is present, `crl` should answer it in the ACK.

The ACK should also include a brief outline of the plan/work that `crl`
understands to be in scope. `team-lead` should wait for that ACK and outline
before raising scope concerns or discussing adjustments with the user.

After both hardening passes complete, `team-lead` should do a second,
critical review focused on whether:
- sprint deliverables are split across sprints adequately
- every committed deliverable is expected to land at a production-ready level
- any sprint still has too many deliverables and should be split now
- sprint deliverables are concrete enough that a dev agent can prove presence
- every sprint doc uses an explicit detailed deliverables list rather than
  umbrella bullets that hide multiple implementation outcomes
- acceptance criteria are explicit enough that `quality-mgr` can verify them
- important interfaces/features/enums/boundaries have explicit code samples or
  signatures
- any remaining residual work still lacks sprint ownership
- any hardening change materially altered the user-discussed deliverable scope
  without explicit user discussion

Do not treat the hardening pass itself as the final review. The handoff is:
1. `team-lead` routes plan hardening to `crl`
2. `crl` completes sprint-scope hardening to zero findings
3. `crl` completes consistency hardening to zero findings
4. `team-lead` critically reviews and pushes back if needed
5. `quality-mgr` performs focused plan QA after that review

Render:
- `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening.xml.j2`
- `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening-consistency.xml.j2`

Example:

```bash
sc-compose render \
  --root .claude/skills/plan-hardening \
  --file plan-hardening.xml.j2 \
  --var-file /tmp/plan-hardening-vars.json

sc-compose render \
  --root .claude/skills/plan-hardening \
  --file plan-hardening-consistency.xml.j2 \
  --var-file /tmp/plan-hardening-vars.json
```

Suggested vars file shape:

```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-1234",
  "phase": "phase-S",
  "description": "Harden the second half of Phase S before implementation resumes.",
  "worktree_path": "/abs/worktree",
  "branch": "feature/pS-plan-hardening",
  "pr_target": "integrate/phase-S",
  "source_of_truth": "- User-approved planning discussion already completed with crl\n- docs/project-plan.md\n- docs/plan-phase-S.md\n- docs/requirements.md\n- docs/architecture.md",
  "questions_or_concerns": "- Confirm whether missing follow-on sprints must be created on this branch if the current phase plan stops too early.",
  "references": "- docs/project-plan.md\n- docs/plan-phase-S.md\n- docs/requirements.md\n- docs/architecture.md"
}
```

## Guardrails

- do not send the task before the worktree exists
- do not rewrite the plan into a freeform summary
- do not let the task stop while remaining work lacks sprint ownership
- do not accept a phase plan that ends before the remaining work ends
- do not accept a sprint that carries more deliverables than can credibly land
  at a production-ready level
- do not allow a committed deliverable to become optional, implicit, or
  silently deferred
- do not allow important interfaces/features/enums/boundary contracts to stay
  prose-only when an explicit code sample or signature is needed
- do welcome improvements that make the plan more explicit, production-ready,
  or better split as long as they stay consistent with the user-discussed
  scope
- do not let hardening silently rewrite the deliverable scope discussed with
  the user
- if `team-lead` input conflicts materially with that scope, stop and push
  back instead of normalizing the new scope into the docs
- do not send the hardened plan to QA before `team-lead` has critically
  reviewed deliverables, sprint splitting, code-sample completeness, and
  acceptance criteria
